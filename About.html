  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  	<p> <i>Recipe or Restaurant?</i> is intended for every indecisive foodie out there who can never decide on what to eat, how to cook or where to order from.  It focuses specifically on Indian food in Abu Dhabi as the large South Asian population of the UAE’s capital is my target audience. By using this website, you can search for any Indian recipe you would like and recieve a list of potential recipes to follow. By clicking on a recipe, you will be re-directed to the recipe page where you will be presented with the ingredient list, instructions, estimated cooking time and reviews. However, if you find yourself short on time or lacking some ingredients, you can return to the <i>Recipe or Restaurant?</i> page and click on the restaurants button which will give you a list of Abu Dhabi’s best Indian restaurants. By clicking on them you will be re-directed to their Zomato page which lists their address, menus, reviews and allows you to order home delivery. </p>

    <h2>Motivation and Process</h2>

    <p>My motivation for this project came from my recent semester abroad in New York where in the absence of a dining hall, I would constantly struggle to decide if I wanted to cook or eat out that day. This confusion would only be solved after multiple tabs were opened with different recipes and restaurants because sometimes I would find a recipe that didn’t fit the ingredients I had or would take too long to make while other times the restaurants I would find would be too far away or expensive. This is why I wanted to create a website that I could use here in Abu Dhabi which would allow me to consolidate my food hunt to only one tab on my computer. Moreover, due to the abundance of South Asians in the UAE, Indians alone constitute 42% of the total UAE population, I thought my website would have a wider audience and help other confused Indian food enthusiasts. To create my project I first created the html and css files to put in the basic titles on my page. I then created a javascript file in order to create a mashup of two web APis and present it as one unique project. I used the Zomato API to filter for Indian Restaurants in Abu Dhabi. I then figured out how to connect it to my button and translate it to my webpage while ensuring it showed up with the links. Next, I used a recipe API called Edamam to call recipes with their links when the Recipe Search button was clicked. Once my APis began to work I moved on to the design part of my project.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>As for my creative process, my main goal was to make the best product I could possibly create with my limited knowledge of web development. I picked the saffron gradient background because saffron is a color frequently associated with India, it is on the Indian flag, the color of the robes worn by Hindu priests and the spice itself is used to flavor many Indian dishes. I thought the gradient background would be aesthetically pleasing as the color slowly shifts the further you scroll down as you look at various recipes. As I was aiming for a minimalist and clean design, I decided to make my buttons quite simple instead of the flashy examples I found online. I also kept the button text, “recipe search” and “restaurants” very straightforward because my class reading taught me that people don’t pay a lot of attention on websites and become easily confused when buttons have too much text. During user testing, I was told that adding a unique font would give my page some character and some pictures would spruce up my page. I decided to use the font Dancing Script as it was easy to read while also being different from the usual fonts people are used to. The two graphics I added were of money and a ringing alarm clock, I initially wanted to turn these into buttons but I thought it would be too confusing for a user so instead, I put them next to my sub-heading to indicate money versus the time commitment. </p>
    
    <h2>Major Challenges + Data Sources</h2>

    <p>Making this website was challenging every step of the way. From finding a recipe API that didn’t cost me to figuring out how to get data from an API and making it translate to my webpage. I found it difficult to remember what all the different terms meant which is why I plan to make some notecards and learn this so I don’t struggle as much with the next project. However, I learned so much over the course of the two weeks I worked on this project, my major data source was https://w3schools.com which I would turn to every time I couldn’t get my code to work, my other sources were classmates in my Mashups class who did their best to help me out.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

    <p>I would like to personalize the output given by the recipe and restaurant search, for example, I would like to add multiple dollar signs next to restaurants that are very expensive. While a user can find this out when they click on the link and are re-directed to the Zomato site, I would like to display this information earlier and on my page. I would also like to populate my page with a recipe gallery so people who have not tried Indian food can have some idea of what to search. </p>
